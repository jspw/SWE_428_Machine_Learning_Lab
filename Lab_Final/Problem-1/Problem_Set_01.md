As a data scientist working in the healthcare industry, your task is to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) model that can classify medical images into their respective categories. The model should be able to accurately identify the type of medical image shown in an image, based on the image itself.


To complete the task, you can use the following dataset containing 18000+ color images of medical conditions from 5 different categories: Brain MRI,  Chest CT, Abdomen CT, Hand X-ray, and Chest X-ray. Each image is of varying size and has three color channels (RGB). You need to split the dataset for training, validation and testing purpose. 
Note that you may need to preprocess the dataset and balance the classes to avoid a biased model.
