A banking institution wants to develop a model that predicts whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit or not based on their banking behavior. They have collected a dataset of past customers with information about their demographics, account details, and whether they subscribed to a term deposit or not. The bank wants to build a model using Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict whether a new customer will subscribe to a term deposit or not based on their banking behavior.

The dataset used for this problem statement is the "Bank Marketing Data Set" which contains information on customers of a bank. The dataset includes 17 attributes such as customer demographics, account details, and whether the customer subscribed to a term deposit or not. Each customer is classified as either yes or no based on whether they subscribed to a term deposit or not.
