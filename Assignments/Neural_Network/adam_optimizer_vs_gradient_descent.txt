Adam optimizer and gradient descent are both optimization algorithms commonly used in training neural network models.

Gradient descent is a first-order optimization algorithm that works by updating the weights of the model in the opposite direction of the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights. The gradient is calculated by backpropagation through the network, and the weights are updated using the learning rate and the gradient. There are several variants of gradient descent, such as batch gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, and mini-batch gradient descent, which differ in how they update the weights.

Adam optimizer, on the other hand, is a second-order optimization algorithm that combines the benefits of both momentum and adaptive learning rates. It works by maintaining an exponentially decaying average of past gradients and their squares, which is then used to update the weights. The adaptive learning rate is calculated for each weight based on the second moments of the gradients, which helps the optimizer converge faster and avoid local minima.

Compared to gradient descent, Adam optimizer generally requires less hyperparameter tuning and can converge faster, especially for large datasets or complex models. However, it can also be more computationally expensive due to the additional calculations required for the adaptive learning rate. Gradient descent, on the other hand, is a simpler and more computationally efficient algorithm but may require more tuning of the learning rate and other hyperparameters to achieve good performance.
